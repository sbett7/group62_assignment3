										<span class="image left"><img src="images/avatar.jpg" alt="" />
											<p>
												<p>I am originally from the UK, but immigrated to Perth, Western Australia with my family when I was only five years old. My educational background includes gaining a diploma in Beauty Therapy as well as a Diploma in Children’s Education; I have also completed a number of Certificate Three’s in various other subjects. My main spoken language is English, although she does know how to speak very basic Italian.</p>
												<p>My hobbies include horse riding, writing poetry and taking my Miniature Schnauzer for a walk.</p>
												<p>My interest in IT includes web design, although I also have an interest in game development and design. My interest in IT stemmed from my fascination with a ‘Speak and Spell’ toy that I received for Christmas one year as well as working with my late father in the desktop publishing industry.</p>
												<p>My experience in the IT industry includes some basic HTML knowledge and some knowledge of desktop publishing software.</p>

											During the previous assignment, there were a few issues with communication during the second assignment.
											This was caused by issues outside of the team’s control; however, improvements could be made to increase 
											the availability and time without communication between the team.  The team plans to use an application 
											such as Microsoft Teams to resolve this problem.  This will allow us to have instant messaging from the 
											team’s mobile devices, as well as share documents and revisions directly with the team.

									<h1>Career Plans</h1>
										<div style="height: 50px"></div>
										<p><strong>Katherine's Ideal Job: </strong> Project Manager<br>
											<strong>Sean's Ideal Job: </strong> Integration Software Engineer <br>
											<strong>Lillian's Idea Job: </strong>Graduate/Junior Java Developer
										</p>
										<p>
											The common elements between Sean’s job and Katherine’s are that they must have a relevant qualification or 
											background in software engineering and good communication skills. The things that differentiate Katherine’s 
											ideal job from Sean’s are that Sean’s ideal job revolves around developing software for the robotics industry 
											while Katherine’s ideal job revolves around creating content and software for video/MMO and free to play games. 
											Sean’s career differentiates from Katherine’s in that he already has some of the qualifications and skills needed 
											for his ideal job, whereas Katherine does not have any of the needed qualifications or skills needed for her ideal job.
										</p>
										<p>
												Lillian’s ideal job is also different from the other two team members, as it is a web development position 
												that focuses on developing a full stack, using skills such as Java and Gradle.  This position covers both 
												the development of the frontend of a website, and the backend.  This role is similar to the others as it 
												requires good communication skills, and the ability to work well within a team.
										</p>
										<p>
												Comparing the career plans of each member of the team, it can be seen that all careers lead to the development 
												of software in the IT industry.  However, Sean’s career plan appears to be focused on developing software for 
												the robotics field, whereas Katherine’s career plan focuses on management and development of video games.  
												Lillian’s career plan is focused on web application development.  As such it can be seen that the fields 
												each member wishes to enter, is different from each member.
